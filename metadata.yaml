description: The stories are without exception bright, racy, readable, clever." So
  writes the London Literary World in its review of this collection of tales, which
  includes the popular narrative, The Wheel of Love." As comedies these stories are
  filled with wit, ingenuity, and satire and while the plots are varied, each possesses
  a light romantic spirit.
